# DynamicSlyder-on-JS
DynamicSlyder on Java Script with jQuery and Node.js

This is my version of the task:

Create simple server side application in preferable technology (node.js or other) which generates a random number for each new request.

Create a client-side application (javascript with any preferable framework) which makes a request to the server-side application, gets the randomly generated number and uses it to dynamically update Web UI.

On UI there is control which is updated by using the number (for example jquery UI slider which moves horizontally depending on the number value).

To update the number use polling technology - make new requests to server-side every 2 seconds.
